# control-board
Arduino code for Boxbots control board - 3CH R/C receiver input to TB6612 dual h-bridge output

Note that this Arduino code needs a library added to it called EnableInterrupt
https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/enable-interrupt

The files for EnableInterrupt have been copied into the git archive and can be added to the sketch at Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .Zip Library

Happy roboting....
